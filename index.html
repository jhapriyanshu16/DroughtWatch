        <div class="thirdsectionovertextbox">
        <p>Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It is
          a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage. Drought can
          have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.

          An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most serious
          hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the world. Drought threatens people&#34;s livelihoods,
          increases the risk of disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the
          world&#34;s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of
          drought by 2030.

          Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions drier and wet regions wetter. In
          dry regions, this means that when temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the
          risk of drought or prolongs periods of drought. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural
          hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and
          severe storms.</p>

      <div class="thirdsectionmainbox">
        <h3>CAUSES OF DROUGHT</h3>
        <div class="thirdsectionsecondbox">
          <p>Drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low precipitation that can have severe impacts on agriculture,
            water supplies, and ecosystems. There are several natural and human-caused factors that can contribute to
            drought:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Climate variability: Climate patterns such as El Niño and La Niña can lead to changes in precipitation
              patterns, resulting in drought conditions.
            </li>
            <li>Deforestation: Trees absorb water from the soil and release it back into the atmosphere through a
              process called transpiration. Deforestation reduces the number of trees, which can lead to reduced
              rainfall and increased drought risk.
            </li>
            <li>Land use changes: Land use changes such as urbanization, agriculture, and mining can alter the
              hydrological cycle, leading to decreased water availability and increased drought risk.
            </li>
            <li>Global warming: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts in many
              regions of the world due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.
            </li>
            <li>Natural disasters: Natural disasters such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions can alter the water cycle,
              leading to decreased precipitation and increased drought risk.
            </li>
            <li>Human activities: Overuse and mismanagement of water resources, such as over-extraction of groundwater
              and inefficient irrigation practices, can ex acerbate drought conditions.
            </li>
            <li>Water infrastructure failures: Aging or poorly maintained water infrastructure can lead to water
              shortages and contribute to drought conditions.
            </li>

        </div>
        <h3>EFFECTS OF DROUGHT</h3>
        <div class="thirdsectionsecondbox">
          <p>Drought is a natural disaster that occurs when an area receives lower than average rainfall for an extended
            period. Its effects can be severe and wide-ranging, impacting many aspects of human and natural systems.
            Some of the main effects of drought include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Crop failure: Drought can lead to crop failures, resulting in reduced yields, food shortages, and higher
              prices for food.
            </li>
            <li>Water shortages: Drought can result in reduced water supplies, leading to water shortages for drinking,
              irrigation, and industrial purposes.
            </li>
            <li>Wildlife and ecosystem impacts: Drought can lead to decreased biodiversity, as wildlife and plants
              struggle to survive in harsh conditions. It can also cause ecosystem shifts, such as an increase in
              wildfires or changes in water availability.
            </li>
            <li>Economic impacts: Drought can have severe economic impacts, particularly in agricultural areas, as
              farmers and ranchers may lose income due to crop failures and livestock deaths.
            </li>
            <li>Health impacts: Drought can impact human health by reducing access to clean water and food, leading to
              malnutrition, dehydration, and the spread of waterborne diseases.
            </li>
            <li>Social impacts: Drought can also lead to social impacts, such as migration of people from affected areas
              to other regions, or conflicts over scarce resources.
            </li>
